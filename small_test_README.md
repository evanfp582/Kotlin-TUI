# Kotlin-TUI

---
Make a Kotlin Terminal User Interface from scratch 

## TODO

---------------
Activities with higher priority are put to the top of the list.  
I am not sure what I want to do with done tasks tbh. Maybe just leave them 

- [x] Better onEnter function for select
  - Like the ability to go to multiple screens
  - Created a version of a router
- [ ] Design "Programs" screen for project homebase
- [ ] Style in middle of text
  - I think I may have accidentally done this
- [X] Normal Buttons
  - I think it is weird I did not think of this earlier
  - I need to design a button and how to show when a button is pressed
  - I ended up separating this into two components. A button that does something when pressed and a toggle button 
```cmd
./gradlew clean fatJar; java -jar build/libs/Kotlin-TUI.jar
```
